# Job Role Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about job roles, skills, and related attributes. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and prepare the data for further data science or machine learning workflows.

---

## ðŸ§  Objectives
- Understand data structure and quality
- Handle missing and duplicate values
- Explore numerical and categorical features
- Identify correlations and patterns
- Visualize distributions and outliers

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
**File:** `enhanced_job_role_dataset_1000 (1).xlsx`  
**Format:** Excel  
**Size:** 1000+ entries  
**Description:** Contains job role information and various professional attributes.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š EDA Process
1. Data Loading & Inspection  
2. Data Cleaning (Missing & Duplicates)  
3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis  
4. Visualization of Key Insights  
5. Correlation Analysis and Outlier Detection  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights (Sample)
- Certain job roles dominate the dataset.
- Some numeric features show skewness and outliers.
- Correlations between skill level and salary bands.
